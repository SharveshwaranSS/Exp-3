# Exp - 3 RAILWAY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

# AIM:
The railway management system is given here.

# SRS (Procedure):
1)USE CASE : A use case diagram is a type of behavioral diagram in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) that visually represents the interactions between actors (users or other systems) and a system to achieve specific goals, called use cases.

2)CLASS: A class diagram is a type of structural diagram in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) that shows the static structure of a system by representing its classes, their attributes, methods (operations), and the relationships between them.

3)ACTIVITY: An activity diagram is a type of behavioral diagram in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) that models the workflow or processes of a system, showing the sequence of activities and the flow of control between them.

4)COMMUNICATION: A communication diagram models the interactions between objects or parts in terms of sequenced messages, focusing on the relationships and message flow between them during a specific use case or process.

5)PACKAGE: A package diagram represents the organization and dependencies among packages in a system, helping to group related classes or components and manage system complexity.

6)SEQUENCE: A sequence diagram models the interaction between objects in a time-ordered sequence, showing how messages are sent and received to carry out a specific functionality or use case.
